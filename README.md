# AI ideas

AI idea hub containing small experiments.

At the moment this is mainly ideas I have gathered while trying to write simple NN library. It was inspired by fast.ai part 2, but  instead of looking at provided notebooks I have peeked only at PyTorch code and then tried to replicate that without glympsing. N otebooks intentionally contain full line of thought and try to show what steps I had to take. I plan to extend this by adding some more ideas.
